\title{Compute Recommended Group Separation for Signal-Seeking Studies}
\usage{
calculate_group_separation_thresholds(
  sd,
  delta_ref,
  effect_size = c("small", "moderate", "large", "very_large")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sd}{Numeric. The standard deviation of the outcome.}

\item{delta_ref}{Numeric. The expected mean effect level for the reference group (e.g., Group 1).}

\item{effect_size}{Character. One of: "small", "moderate", "large", "very_large".}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{delta_ref}{The reference group effect (input).}
\item{sd}{The standard deviation (input).}
\item{cohen_d}{The Cohen's d threshold used.}
\item{delta_target}{The recommended target group effect to achieve the specified effect size.}
\item{delta_difference}{The required difference between groups.}
}
}
\description{
This function computes the recommended effect size for a second group
given a reference effect, standard deviation, and a desired effect size category
(small, moderate, large, or very large), based on Cohen's d thresholds.
}
\details{
Cohen's d is a standardized measure of effect size:
d = (Delta_2 - Delta_1) / SD

Typical Cohen's d thresholds are:
\itemize{
\item Small effect:    d = 0.2
\item Moderate effect: d = 0.5
\item Large effect:    d = 0.8
\item Very large:      d = 1.0+
}

In signal-seeking settings (e.g., early-phase studies, biomarker exploration),
moderate to large effect sizes (d = 0.5 to 0.8) are often recommended to ensure
a detectable signal, particularly under noisy conditions.
